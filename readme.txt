# Procedural Terrain (Shiwei Ge):
> To implement the noise function for the height of the mountain I used fractal brownian noise overtop of perlin noise. For the rolling hills I used Worley noise. To interpolate bewteen biomes I used Perlin noise with a very large grid size. When this perlin noise was above 0.5 that signified mountains and below signified rolling hills. In between 0.4 and 0.6 I interpolated with the glm::mix function to provide a smoother transition between the regions.To test the noise functions I created I modified my HW4 and using a shader. I also created two Biomes field. The first mountain field is from 0<x<32, 0<z<64. The second Grassland field is from 32<x<64, 0<z<64.If the block is above 200 and it is the top, the block will be snow with color {1,1,1}. And between 128 and 138, it will be water if it's empty.
